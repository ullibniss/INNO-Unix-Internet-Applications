# Task 1. PXE Installation

## 1.1. Create the first virtual machine using VirtualBox and isolate a private network on your workstation: do not pollute our shared network with your own DHCP service. There are several network settings offered by VirtualBox, choose the right one accordingly and Install your PXE server there. Hint: use two network adapters.

I decided to create Ubuntu 24.04.01 LTS virtual machine for PXE server.
